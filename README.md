# Hadoop Map-Reduce Job project
This project is made by maven, which use to test Hadoop MR task.
The MR job is to compute the max temperature of each years.

Input temperature data into HDFS: 
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal ~/Downloads/temperature_data.txt /user/rich/temperatureInput

Remove output directory if existed in HDFS:
hadoop fs -rmr /user/rich/MaxTempOutput

Execute MR job
Step1 build project
mvn clean package

Step2 execute jar and run Max temperature output
hadoop jar /RICH_HD/Projects/BigData_Project/MRJob/target/MRJob-1.0-job.jar /user/rich/temperatureInput /user/rich/MaxTempOutput

Step3 view result 
hadoop fs -cat /user/rich/MaxTempOutput/part-00000
